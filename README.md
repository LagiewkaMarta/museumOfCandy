## Museum of Candy
🍭🍬Museum of Candy Bootstrap Project -- starter files from Colt Steele's course on Bootstrap 4🍬🍭


🍬 A rather simple website created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, and a sprinkle of JavaScript.  However minimalistic, it takes advantage of quite a few bootstrap features -- including the grid system, nested grids, and flexbox utilities.
